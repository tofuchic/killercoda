# Step 3: Run the example

1. In the LEFT tab, compile and execute the server code.

    ```bash
    go run greeter_server/main.go
    ```{{exec}}

1. In the RIGHT tab, execute the client code to see the client output.

    ```bash
    go run greeter_client/main.go
    ```{{exec}}

1. Let's leave the server application running for a while. (Leave the LEFT tab running.)

    - Next, you will update the `.proto`{{}} file and update the client codes only.
    - Imagine what will happen if you execute the client codes.
