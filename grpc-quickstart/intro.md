# Intorduction

This scenario is written in the [gRPC Go Quick start](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).(As of Nov. 2023)

Let's get started.

In this scenario, you will run the example applications of gRPC.
The example applications code exists in [the official gRPC repository](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go), so you first have to clone it.
After you clone the respository, you can run server and client applications respectively.
Then, you can learn how to change the schema and develop your applications.

But before all of them, you must fulfill the prerequisites.
