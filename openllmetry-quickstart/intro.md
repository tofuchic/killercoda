# Intorduction

This scenario is based on the [OpenLLMetry Getting Started](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started).(As of July. 2024)

Let's get started.

In this scenario, you will create and run the python scripts of OpenLLMetry.
The official example applications code exists in [the repository](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry/tree/main/packages/sample-app), and it will be cloned automatically.

For python execution, [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) is under installing.
Wait until the terminal echoes `Hello...'`{{}}, you may have to wait 3-4 minutes.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
cd openllmetry/packages/sample-app
```{{exec}}
