# Intorduction

This scenario is based on the [OpenLLMetry Getting Started](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started).(As of July. 2024)

Let's get started.

In this scenario, you will run the example applications of OpenLLMetry.
The example applications code exists in [the repository](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry/tree/main/packages/sample-app), so you first have to clone it.

For python execution, `[rye](https://rye.astral.sh/)` is under installing.
Please wait until the terminal echo `Hello`.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
cd openllmetry/packages/sample-app
```{{exec}}
